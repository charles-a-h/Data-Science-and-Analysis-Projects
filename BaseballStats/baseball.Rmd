## Introduction and Project Overview
This analysis utilizes a popular ongoing collection of baseball data that has historic data since 1871.^1^  There is an extensive amount of data that has been collected, however we would like to determine if it is possible to predict which type of scoring method for batting has the highest probability of winning a game.

The type of analysis that will be used is multiple linear regression, also known as multivariable linear regression.  This type of regression is a generalization of simple linear regression and has more than one independent variable (multiple predictors).

If we consider the following formula:

**Multiple Linear Regression**
$$Y_{i} = β_{0j} + β_{1j}X_{i1} + β_{2j}X_{i2} + ... + β_{pj}X_{ip} + ε_{ij}$$ 

*   $Y_{i}$ = i^th^ observation of the dependent variable; 
*   $β$ = Parameters being estimated
*   $X$ = i^th^ observation of the j^th^ independent variable
*   $i$ = 1, ..., n for all independent variables
*   $j$ = 1, ..., p for all dependent variables
*   $ε_{ij}$ = i^th^ observation of the dependent variable error; j^th^ observations of the independent variable error

## The Lahman Dataset

This analysis will use the "Teams" data, and will analyze the following variables: 

  + **Bases on balls (BB):** a pitcher does not throw the ball into the strike zone, and the batter walks to first base.
  + **Single:** the batter hits the ball and makes it to first base.
  + **Double:** the batter hits the ball and makes it to second base.
  + **Triple:** the batter hits the ball and makes it to third base.
  + **Homeruns (HRs):** a player hits the ball outside of the baseball park boundary and scores, as well as any other players on bases score.

A full list of the variables can be reviewed from the summary statistics:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
# Summary stats
# str(Teams)
# summary(Teams$yearID)
# summary(Teams$W)
# summary(Teams$L)
# summary(Teams$BB) # Bases on balls 
# summary(Teams$SB) # Single
# summary(Teams$X2B) # Double
# summary(Teams$X3B) # Triple
summary(Teams)
```
The initial process step includes exploring some of the data, these scatterplots show the relationship of homeruns, bases on balls, and singles that have lead to winning games.

**Scatterplot review**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = 'center', echo=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(hrwin, bbwin, swins, dwins, twins, nrow = 3)
```
## Determine the Regression Line Value

Now that we have visualized this data, let's compute the slope of the regression line for these relationships:
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width='75%', fig.align = 'center'}
# Compute the Slope of the regression line for BB
bb_slope <- Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID %in% 1917:2021) %>% 
  mutate(BB_per_game = BB/G, wins_per_game = W/G) %>% 
  lm(wins_per_game ~ BB_per_game, data = .) %>% 
  .$coef %>%
  .[2]
bb_slope

# Compute the Slope of the regression line for singles
singles_slope <- Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID %in% 1917:2021) %>% 
  mutate(singles_per_game = (H-HR-X2B-X3B) / G, wins_per_game = W/G) %>% 
  lm(wins_per_game ~ singles_per_game, data = .) %>% 
  .$coef %>%
  .[2]
singles_slope

# Compute the Slope of the regression line for doubles
doubles_slope <- Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID %in% 1917:2021) %>% 
  mutate(doubles_per_game = X2B /G, wins_per_game = W/G) %>% 
  lm(wins_per_game ~ doubles_per_game , data = .) %>% 
  .$coef %>%
  .[2]
doubles_slope

# Compute the Slope of the regression line for triples
triples_slope <- Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID %in% 1917:2021) %>% 
  mutate(triples_per_game = X3B /G, wins_per_game = W/G) %>% 
  lm(wins_per_game ~ triples_per_game, data = .) %>% 
  .$coef %>%
  .[2]
triples_slope

# Compute the Slope of the regression line for homeruns
bb_slope <- Teams %>% 
  filter(yearID %in% 1917:2021) %>% 
  mutate(HR_per_game = HR/G, wins_per_game = W/G) %>% 
  lm(wins_per_game ~ HR_per_game, data = .) %>% 
  .$coef %>%
  .[2]
bb_slope
```
## Results and Conclusion

Not to our surprise, homeruns led to more winning games, however they were closely followed by triples, then doubles.  Strangely enough, bases on balls lead to more winning games than singles.  The next time you watch a baseball game, don’t assume that a team will lose the game if you see their batters walking to first base from bases on balls!

Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
